## TDD(Test Driven Development)

### Book : Test Driven Development by exmaple(Kent Beck)


### Phase of TDD
- Red : write a little test that doesn’t work, perhaps doesn’t even compile at first
- Green : make the test work quickly, committing whatever sins necessary in the
process
- Refactor : eliminate all the duplication created in just getting the test to work


### Cycle of TDD
1. Quickly add a test
2. Run all tests and see the new one fail
3. Make a little change
4. Run all tests and see them all succeed
5. Refactor to remove duplication

### Test Patterns
1. arrange - create object
2. act - do something
3. assert - check the result

## constraints
performance  - as soon as possible
isolation - result of the test doesn't affect the others
